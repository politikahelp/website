The `poc-theme` is based off of [the theme](https://itimetraveler.github.io/hexo-theme-hiero/) - whose github repo is [here](https://github.com/iTimeTraveler/hexo-theme-hiero).

"Based off of" i.e. mostly copied, style-wise. A lot of things need to be removed. Not everything is being un-tangled i.e. some things might be copy-pasted which we do not need but might be too time consuming to discern as such atm. Mostly, this applies to styles - but it can apply to other things.

Obviously, the blog post format needs to be changed.
